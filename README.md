# Recommender-Systems
A recommendation system, which is a subclass of information filtering systems, aims to anticipate the rating or preference a user may assign to a certain item. Simply put, it is an algorithm that directs consumers to relevant items.

### Collaborative Filtering Method
User Interaction Matrix are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations. The two sub-categories of collaborative filtering algorithms are generally referred to as memory-based and model-based approaches. The fundamental benefit of collaborative techniques is that they may be applied in a variety of circumstances because they don't need to know anything about the users or the products.

### Content Based Method
The goal of content-based methods is to attempt to create a model that can account for the observed user-item interactions based on the "features" that are currently available. Compared to collaborative approaches, content-based solutions are far less susceptible to the cold start issue since new individuals or things may be described by their qualities, which allows for the creation of pertinent ideas for these new entities. This disadvantage will presumably only affect new users or products with previously undiscovered features, but once the system is old enough, this has little to no probability of occurring.

Evaluation methods for recommender systems can mainly be divided in two sets: evaluation based on well defined metrics and evaluation mainly based on human judgment and satisfaction estimation.
